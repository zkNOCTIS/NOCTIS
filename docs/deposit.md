# How to Deposit

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Go to [zknoctis.com](https://zknoctis.com)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.)
4. Approve the connection

## Step 2: Enter Deposit Amount

1. In the **Deposit** card, enter the amount of NOCTIS you want to deposit
2. You can use the preset buttons (1,000 / 5,000 / 10,000 / 50,000) or enter a custom amount

## Step 3: Approve & Deposit

1. Click **Deposit**
2. First transaction: Approve the vault to spend your NOCTIS (one-time per amount)
3. Second transaction: Deposit into the vault

## Step 4: Save Your Note

**CRITICAL**: After the deposit confirms, a note will appear in **My Notes**.

1. Click the copy button on your note
2. Save this note somewhere safe (password manager, encrypted file, etc.)
3. This note is required to withdraw - if you lose it, your funds are lost forever

## What Happens On-Chain

- Your NOCTIS tokens are transferred to the vault
- A cryptographic commitment (hash) is stored in a Merkle tree
- The commitment reveals nothing about your identity or amount
- Only you have the secret keys needed to withdraw
